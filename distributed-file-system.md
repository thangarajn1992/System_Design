# Distributed File System (DFS)

Distributed file systems are storage solutions designed to manage and provide access to files and directories across multiple servers, nodes, or machines, often distributed over a network. They enable users and applications to access and manipulate files as if they were stored on a local file system, even though the actual files might be physically stored on multiple remote servers. Distributed file systems are often used in large-scale or distributed computing environments to provide fault tolerance, high availability, and improved performance.
