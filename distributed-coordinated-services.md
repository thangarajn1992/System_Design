# Distributed Coordinated Services

Distributed coordination services are systems designed to manage and coordinate the activities of distributed applications, services, or nodes in a reliable, efficient, and fault-tolerant manner. They help maintain consistency, handle distributed synchronization, and manage the configuration and state of various components in a distributed environment. Distributed coordination services are particularly useful in large-scale or complex systems, such as those found in microservices architectures, distributed computing environments, or clustered databases. Examples of such service are *Apache ZooKeeper, etcd, Consul*.
