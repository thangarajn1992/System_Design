# Full Text Search

Full-text search enables users to search for specific words or phrases within an app or website. When a user queries, the app or website returns the most relevant results. To do this quickly and efficiently, full-text search relies on an **inverted index**, which is a data structure that maps words or phrases to the documents in which they appear. An example of such systems is *Elastic Search*.
