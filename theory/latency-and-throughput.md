# Latency & Throughput

**Latency** is time to perform some action or to produce some result. **Throughput** is the number of such actions or results per unit time. In general, we should aim for **maximal throughput with acceptable latency.**

**A simple example**

The following manufacturing example should clarify these two concepts:

An assembly line is manufacturing cars. It takes eight hours to manufacture a car and that the factory produces one hundred and twenty cars per day.

The latency is: 8 hours.

The throughput is: 120 cars / day or 5 cars / hour.
