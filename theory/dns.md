# DNS

DNS architecture is a hierarchical distributed database and an associated set of protocols that define:

* A mechanism for querying and updating the database.
* A mechanism for replicating the information in the database among servers.
* A schema of the database.

To know more about the DNS, please refer to my Networking Protocols Repository.
