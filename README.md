# System Design

System Design is the most used and scariest word when it comes to interviews at great companies for even experienced professionals. Well, no repository will be enough to contain everything about system design as system design means every design of every system in the world out there.&#x20;

So why this repository ? First and foremost is to keep track of whatever I learn from various resources for me to look back when I need. Second, if someone needs to take a peek at this repository for notes created by a learner, then this repository will serve their usecase.

My initial idea is to document my notes while reading [Designing Data-Intensive Applications: The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems](https://www.amazon.in/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications-Reliable-Maintainable/dp/9352135245/ref=sr\_1\_1?crid=1NQ1CWGONM704\&dchild=1\&keywords=designing+data-intensive+applications\&qid=1630344802\&sprefix=Designing+dat%2Caps%2C-1\&sr=8-1) By [Martin Kleppmann](https://www.amazon.in/Martin-Kleppmann/e/B00Q43XKD6/ref=dp\_byline\_cont\_book\_1) one of the best books available in the market.
