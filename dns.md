# DNS

Domain Name System (DNS) is a fundamental component of the internet infrastructure that translates human-friendly domain names into their corresponding IP addresses. It functions like a phonebook for the internet, allowing users to access websites and services by typing in easily memorable domain names, such as www.designgurus.iorather than the numerical IP addresses like “192.0.2.1” that computers use to identify each other.

When you enter a domain name into your web browser, the DNS is responsible for locating the associated IP address and directing your request to the correct server. The process begins with your computer sending a query to a recursive resolver, which then searches a series of DNS servers, starting with the root server, followed by the Top-Level Domain (TLD) server, and finally the authoritative name server. Once the IP address is found, the recursive resolver returns it to your computer, allowing your browser to establish a connection with the target server and access the desired content.
