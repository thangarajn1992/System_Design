# Distributed Messaging Service

Distributed messaging systems enable the exchange of messages between multiple, potentially geographically-dispersed applications, services, or components in a reliable, scalable, and fault-tolerant manner. They facilitate communication by decoupling the sender and receiver components, allowing them to evolve and operate independently. Distributed messaging systems are particularly useful in large-scale or complex systems, such as those found in microservices architectures or distributed computing environments. Examples of such systems are Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ.
